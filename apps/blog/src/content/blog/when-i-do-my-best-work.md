> Solving problems not executing on solutions

I work best when presented with big problems. And, to me, **no problem is more exciting than reaching PMF.** 

I like to question assumptions, and make use of my [multi-disciplinary knowledge](/blog/stuff-i-practice) to solve solutions. 

> I like to work with weirdos who have integrity 

**I work best when there's at least one other person who's a bit of an outlier**, someone who at the minimum can picture unconventional way to do work, and is ready to experiment with things that are outside of what is considered best practices. **And, either me or the other outlier has significant leverage within the organization to enact change**.

Most company I worked with have two types of people:
 1. Improvement-driven: People who continually focus on how to do things right 
 2. Idea-driven[^1] : People who continually focus on how to do the right thing.

Most people have some percentage of both these traits. And most companies, on average a certain distribution of people with this traits.

**I'm a type idea-driven person (95% type 2, 5% type1)** - I care about building the right thing. To build the right things you sometimes need to go beyond the standard and accepted way to move forward.

To have a healthy startup, I believe you need to have 80% of "Improvement-driven" people, 20% of type "idea-driven" people.

**Startups where everyone focuses on doing *the right thing* rarely see projects until completion** because there's is a constant reinvention that takes places all the time. And ideas need time to sink in. [time-is-a-necessary-process-for-success](/blog/time-is-a-necessary-process-for-success).

**Startups where everyone is focused on how to do *the things right* often see projects to completion, but they tend to create useless products.** The assumption being that you're building the right thing - which is something you can't ever know.

I usually do my best work in companies that exhibit something close to this ratio.

[^1]: It's important to note that being idea-driven doesn't mean you cannot execute on the idea. It is more about what drives you to execute.
