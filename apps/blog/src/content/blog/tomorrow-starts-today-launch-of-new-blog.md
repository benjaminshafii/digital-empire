Been on a long-form (more than 280 chars) hiatus for about a year now. This changes today. I find it hard to compound knowledge from tweets and enjoy just writing thoughts as they flow through my brain, often revealing unexpected details about my thought patterns. Both X 280-chars posts and long-form make my gaping holes in knowledge obvious , but somehow only long-form allows me to untangle where the misunderstanding arises. So, hello - again.
