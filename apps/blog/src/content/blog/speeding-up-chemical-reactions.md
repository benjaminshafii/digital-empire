Fours ways:
1. Increase temperature
2. Increase concentration
3. Increase surface area
4. Use [catalysts](/blog/catalysts)


Useful for startups:
- Increasing temperature -> Increasing stress (short deadlines, big presentation, etc.)
- Increasing concentration -> Spending more time working / More focused work
- Increase surface area ???
- Using catalysts -> going through an accelerator
