but it shouldn't. what you're seeing here is a feature. not a codebase.

the underlying thought is that as you code more, you should move from left to right. but you shouldn’t.

every new feature starts at raptor 1 again. that’s because you’re unconstrained by physical work. there’s no real cost to exploration. so each feature needs to earn its way from left to right.

you only move a feature forward if it keeps being traversed.

what we’re seeing here is a software feature that’s been traversed so many times that its shape is obvious. when you traverse a path a million times, you don't only know how to optimize it, you should.
