Making sense of two opposing opinions I have about remote work:
1. I do not like remote work
2. Remote work is more resilient

I know there exist  people out there who really enjoy remote work. I'm not one of them.

Remote work is a necessary evil to create a more resilient organization - not a first choice.

People have obligations: family members and close friends in far off places. You don't want to lose a good hire because they sometimes are bound to these.

**I really enjoy being in the room with folks I work with.** It's not a statement about an objectively better way to work, it's a statement about my *preferred* way to work.

And even though I can't prove it, **I believe that the opportunity for outsized returns are more likely to emerge from environments who have some amount of chaos.**
